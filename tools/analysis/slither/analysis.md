# Slither
[Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) is a framework for static analysis of Solidity and Vyper, written in Python3,
offering several features for stability and security checks:
- Detection of vulnerable Solidity code with low false positives
- Identification of error conditions in source code
- Integration into CI and Hardhat/Foundry builds
- Built-in 'printers' for swift reporting of crucial contract information
- Provided detector API; a tool for integrating custom and tailored analyses
- Ability to analyze contracts written with Solidity >= 0.4
- Intermediate representation [SlithIR](https://github.com/trailofbits/slither/wiki/SlithIR) enables simple,
  high-precision analyses
- Integrates with Github's code scanning in CI
- Supports Vyper Smart Contracts

## Installation:
#### Prerequisite - set up solidity:
- Python 3.8+.
- [Supported compilation framework]() or Solidity compiler, it is recommended to use
  [solc-select](https://github.com/crytic/solc-select?tab=readme-ov-file) (note: for ARM processor architecture
  [Rosetta](https://github.com/crytic/solc-select?tab=readme-ov-file#oserror-errno-86-bad-cpu-type-in-executable)
  dependency will be needed)
- Installation of Slither via pip package manager is done via:  `python3 -m pip install slither-analyzer`, for
  other methods and detailed process explanation follow [how to install](https://github.com/crytic/slither?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-install)
  section

#### Example of use `solc-select`
```shell
solc-select install 0.8.25
solc-select use 0.8.25
```
#### Follow up with the desired setup.
## Working Principle:
Slither's main working principle is based on converting solidity Smart Contracts code into the
intermediate representation called SlithIR which is used under the hood
[SSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single-assignment_form) and reduced instruction set to
perform program analysis like [dataflow analysis](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.html)
or [taint checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taint_checking).
General Slither architecture is shown below on the fig. 1.

According to the paper ["Slither: A Static Analysis Framework For Smart Contracts"](https://agroce.github.io/wetseb19.pdf),
we can distinguish 4 main angles, in which the tool might be used:
* **Automated vulnerability detection**: a large variety of
  Smart Contract vulnerabilities can be detected without user intervention.
* **Automated optimization detection**: Slither detects code
  optimizations that the compiler misses
* **Code understanding**: printers summarize and display
  contractsâ€™ information to aid in the study of the codebase.
* **Assisted code review**: through its API, a user can interact
  with Slither.
## Tool analysis:
Slither takes [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) structure that is generated
during the compilation process using `solc` compiler and recovering metadata from it, including analyzing inheritance graph,
[control flow graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph) and the list of all expressions.
The entire bytecode is transformed into Slither's own IR (Intermediate Representation) which allows to capture of more details,
useful in the next stages of static analysis.
> **NOTE:**
> Slither is not executing any code provided by the user, the entire analysis provided by the tool is performed on the bytecode,
> therefore deployment context and environment are not taken into account, and analysis is strictly static.
## Research directions and conclusions:
### Contract may be provided to Slither in two different methods:
1) as an address of the already deployed contract: `NETWORK:0x...`, *as of April 2024, Headera is not listed within the
   available provider list*.
> Supported networks: mainet, optim, ropsten, kovan, goerli, sepolia, tobalaba, bsc, testnet.bsc, arbi, testnet.arbi,
> poly, mumbai, avax, testnet.avax, ftm, goerli.base
2) By providing Smart Contract implementation in Solidity.
### Adding Headera RPC support for Slither:
Some tools do not have any option to set custom RPC nor use Hedera block explorers, those are:
- `slither-mutate`
- `slither-interface`
- `slither-check-erc`
#### Attempt to run Slither's RPC call using hashio.io with the use of `slither-read-storage`:
The baseline test on Ethereum main net was compleated successfully following result:
`slither-read-storage 0x8ad599c3a0ff1de082011efddc58f1908eb6e6d8 --json storage_layout.json`
```json
{
  "slot0": {
    "name": "slot0",
    "type_string": "UniswapV3Pool.Slot0",
    "slot": 0,
    "size": 256,
    "offset": 0,
    "value": null,
    "elems": {
      "sqrtPriceX96": {
        "name": "slot0.sqrtPriceX96",
        "type_string": "uint160",
        "slot": 0,
        "size": 160,
        "offset": 0,
        "value": null,
        "elems": {}
      },
    ...
```
For Hashscan test, verified mainnet contract was choosen:
```dtd
Address: `0x00000000000000000000000000000000002e7a5d` \
HashscanLink: https://hashscan.io/mainnet/contract/0.0.3045981?type=contractcall&p=1&k=1714033671.497715003 \
Name: `UniswapV2Router02`
```
Execution of command:    
`slither-read-storage 0x00000000000000000000000000000000002e7a5d --json storage_layout.json --rpc-url https://mainnet.hashio.io/api`
yields `ERROR:SlitherSolcParsing` with details available [here](log/read_storage_error.md).
The tested Hedera contract is verified and the code is available. Therefore, the tool should be able to fetch it and parse it properly.
Unfortunately performing this procedure on the current version of Slither is not enough to run tests for contracts deployed
on the Hashscan.

There are also additional options to configure integration with various block explorers APIs.

There is no option of integration with [hashscan](https://hashscan.io).
Deeper investigation in code of the tool, reveals that upon RPC call, library method: `eth_getStorageAt`
is beeing used:
```python
        hex_bytes = get_storage_data(
            self.rpc_info.web3,
            self.checksum_address,
            int.to_bytes(slot_info.slot, 32, byteorder="big"),
            self.rpc_info.block,
        )
```

```python
def get_storage_data(
    web3: Web3, checksum_address: ChecksumAddress, slot: bytes, block: Union[int, str]
) -> bytes:

    return bytes(web3.eth.get_storage_at(checksum_address, slot, block)).rjust(32, bytes(1))
```
[By documentation](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-json-rpc-relay/blob/main/docs/rpc-api.md) Slither
should be compatible with the Headera, as it is listed as a supported enpoint. 
#### RPC responses comparison between the ehtereum mainnet and the Headera network:
ETH:
Contract address: `0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564`
RPC url: `https://eth.llamarpc.com`
Request payload:
```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "eth_getStorageAt",
    "params": [
        "0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564",
        "0x0",
        "latest"
    ],
    "id": 0
}
```

Response:
```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": "0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff",
    "id": 0
}
```


Hedera:
Contract address: `0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564`
RPC url: `https://mainnet.hashio.io/api`
Request payload:
```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "eth_getStorageAt",
    "params": [
        "0x00000000000000000000000000000000002e7a5d",
        "0x0",
        "latest"
    ],
    "id": 0
}
```

Response:
```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "id": 0
}
```

Happy path returns data in exactly the same format. There is no difference when it comes to the hashio rpc node and example ethereum node.


The only difference that is worth noticing is the different behaviour of the Hedera node when state data is not found. Hedera RPC throws error but ethereum rpc just returns zeroes (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`)
Below are examples of this situation:
HEdera RPC error message (state not found under given address):
```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 0,
    "error": {
        "code": -32001,
        "message": "[Request ID: 5edfc294-58f2-4293-a15b-a58661724faf] Requested resource not found. Cannot find current state for contract address 0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564 at slot=0x0"
    }
}
```

Ethereum RPC msg:
```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "id": 0
}
```

### Overview of Slither Detectors and Their Blockchain Specificity
Solidity code is not tied to a particular blockchain; it is crafted for platforms that uphold the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). 
Hence, Slither doesn't necessitate modifications or improvements for distinct chains. It hasn't integrated any rules or 
supplementary details specific to a chain, and presently, there are no chain-specific detectors in the official project repository

### Test summary:
* Test contracts were performed on different Solidity versions: {0.4.11, 0.4.19, 0.8.9}.
  Running Slither on an incorrect language version can yield unexpected Python exceptions -
  some error cases are not properly handled within the Slither implementation
* Calling Internal Hedera System functions are reported by Slither as `low-level-calls` which is categorized as
  `Informational` impact type. This means that no additional actions need to be made for Slither to Hedera compatibility -
  from the tool perspective, those are just normal address calls, as the potential solution it may be beneficial to
  ensure that Slither will recognize address 0x167 as assigned to Hedera's internal system functions.
* Slither's Detectors provide API that may be used to provide custom internal Hedera checks such as:
    * ecrecover is not supported for ED25519 accounts
    * precompiles that are missing in the Hedera EVM
      example of detector implementation POC may be found [here](detectors/hedera/ecrecover_usage_local.py)
* It might be beneficial to introduce eth tools -> Hashscan compatibility layer proxy API that would enable
  transparent communication between Hashscan and Slither.
* Tests didn't generate any kind of high-impact vulnerability. The Table below depicts a detailed histogram
  of the reported issues by the Slither (for hts-precompile contracts):
